I apologize for the incomplete nature of my assignment. I ran into some serious technical issues and I take responsibility for that failure. I recently made some changes to my OS and messed up my Docker container. 

As you said in class that you would rather I explain how I would finish this assignment I will take this space to do so. After reading in the file from the command line I planned to remove any white space in the text. After that I planned to use the stack to iterate through each character to find the delimiters. I would have read in each one, one at a time, after finding an opening delimiters I would reach in each one until a matching closing delimiter was found for each. After this I would clear my stack, thus clearing that block of code. This way I could split the code into blocks, and when I found a missing delimiter I could identify which block it belongs to.
